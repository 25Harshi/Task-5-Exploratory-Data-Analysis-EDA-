# Task-5-Exploratory-Data-Analysis-EDA-

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
📌 Project Overview
This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset to extract insights using statistical and visual methods. It helps understand patterns, trends, and anomalies in passenger survival rates.

🛠 Tools Used
Python

Pandas (data manipulation)

Matplotlib & Seaborn (visualizations)

Jupyter Notebook (analysis workflow)

🔍 Steps Covered
✔ Load and explore the dataset using .describe(), .info(), .value_counts() ✔ Visualize relationships with sns.pairplot(), sns.heatmap() ✔ Identify trends with histograms, boxplots, scatterplots ✔ Write observations for each visual representation ✔ Provide a summary of findings

📊 Key Insights
Gender Impact: Higher survival rates for females.

Class Difference: First-class passengers had better survival chances.

Fare Correlation: Expensive tickets increased survival likelihood.

Age & Survival: Younger passengers had a slightly higher survival rate.
